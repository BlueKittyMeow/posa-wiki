        "description": "A song about a dog and a treat.\n\nPart of the reason I uploaded this video was to raise awareness of a condition called, \"Dog Bloat.\" The dog in this video, Hachi, passed away due to this condition.\n\nDog bloat caused Hachi's stomach to flip, which is called, \"Gastric Dilatation Volvulus.\" We did all we could to save him and even after surgery we lost him. Learn the signs as early detection is key in saving your dogs life. Ask your vet about preventing this condition. If we had known more, he'd still be he with us.\n\nThis was actually a practice run for this song but we never got a chance to do another take.\n\nThank you for watching!\n\nFollow me on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/matthewposa/",

          "description": "A song about a dog and a treat.\n\nPart of the reason I uploaded this video was to raise awareness of a condition called, \"Dog Bloat.\" The dog in this video, Hachi, passed away due to this condition.\n\nDog bloat caused Hachi's stomach to flip, which is called, \"Gastric Dilatation Volvulus.\" We did all we could to save him and even after surgery we lost him. Learn the signs as early detection is key in saving your dogs life. Ask your vet about preventing this condition. If we had known more, he'd still be he with us.\n\nThis was actually a practice run for this song but we never got a chance to do another take.\n\nThank you for watching!\n\nFollow me on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/matthewposa/"

During that time I caught a 10 lb king salmon and had paddled at least 6 miles with it on my stringer and it created a ton of drag.\n\nWhen we got to camp, I tied off my fish to the dock and put it down in the water to keep it cold. When I came back later to check on it, it was gone. I knew the culprit, Otters.\n\nI went out fishing the next day and caught 2 Lake Trout. This time I knew better than to leave them near the dock, so we walked down to the water, far away from the dock, near our camp and tied them to a tree.\n\nAbout an hour goes by and Funk sees the tree they are tied to shaking and screams, \"POSA!!! OTTERS!!!!\" We both run down to the water and this is what we find.\n\nFollow me on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/matthewposa/",
