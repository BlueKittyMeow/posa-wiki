# Phase 2A QA Findings (Codex)

## 1. Missing Template (High Severity)
- **Issue:** `/auth/profile` view renders `auth/profile.html`, but the template is absent (`blueprints/auth.py:52`).
- **Impact:** Any request to `/auth/profile` raises a 500.
- **Recommendation:** Add `templates/auth/profile.html` or disable the route until implemented.

## 2. Dog Stats Missing Metadata (Medium Severity)
- **Issue:** Dog stats query only returns `video_count` per dog (directory list), yet the template expects `most_featured.name` (`app.py:368-370`, `templates/dogs_list.html:57`).
- **Impact:** “Most Featured” card shows blank name/count.
- **Recommendation:** Update the aggregate query to return dog name (and other fields) or fetch full dog records before computing stats.

## 3. Paged Totals Misreported (Medium Severity)
- **Issue:** Templates display counts based on current page lengths (`series|length`, `trips|length`, `dogs|…|length`). After pagination, these no longer represent the full dataset.
- **Recommendation:** Use `pagination.total` (or precomputed totals from the DB) for display badges so counts remain accurate regardless of pagination.

## 4. FTS Index Maintenance (Medium Severity)
- **Issue:** `build_fts_index.py` drops/rebuilds the FTS table and bulk-loads data but no triggers keep `videos_fts` in sync with `videos`.
- **Impact:** Any new or updated videos require rerunning the script before they appear in search results.
- **Recommendation:** Add FTS triggers or schedule a rebuild after data import scripts to keep the index current.

## 5. Documentation Cleanup (Low Severity)
- **Issue:** Step 3 in `docs/phase-2a.md` duplicates the bullet list (checked & unchecked copies).
- **Recommendation:** Remove the redundant lines to keep the status list concise.

## 6. Logging Configuration Lacks Size Limits (Low-Medium Severity)
- **Issue:** `RotatingFileHandler` in `configure_logging()` (`app.py:72-79`) doesn't specify `maxBytes` or `backupCount` parameters.
- **Impact:** Log files could grow unbounded in production, potentially filling disk space.
- **Recommendation:** Add size limits to RotatingFileHandler:
  ```python
  file_handler = RotatingFileHandler(
      logs_dir / 'posa_wiki.log',
      maxBytes=10_485_760,  # 10MB
      backupCount=5
  )
  ```

## 7. CSRF Security Hardening Missing (Low-Medium Severity)
- **Issue:** Flask-WTF CSRF protection is initialized but lacks security configuration in `config.py`.
- **Impact:** CSRF tokens never expire and lack additional SSL validation in production.
- **Recommendation:** Add to `ProductionConfig` class:
  ```python
  WTF_CSRF_TIME_LIMIT = 3600  # 1 hour token lifetime
  WTF_CSRF_SSL_STRICT = True  # Require SSL for CSRF validation
  ```

## 8. No Production Secret Key Validation (Medium Severity)
- **Issue:** Application uses `SECRET_KEY` default `'dev-secret-change-me'` if `FLASK_SECRET_KEY` env var not set (`config.py:26`).
- **Impact:** Production deployment could run with insecure default key, compromising session security.
- **Recommendation:** Add validation in `ProductionConfig.init_app()`:
  ```python
  @staticmethod
  def init_app(app):
      if app.config['SECRET_KEY'] == 'dev-secret-change-me':
          raise RuntimeError('Production requires FLASK_SECRET_KEY environment variable')
  ```

## 9. Error Templates Not Theme-Tested (Low Severity)
- **Issue:** Error templates (`templates/errors/404.html`, `500.html`) extend `base.html` but no explicit verification they render properly with all three themes and with/without authenticated users.
- **Impact:** Error pages might display incorrectly in edge cases (e.g., error during login).
- **Recommendation:** Add manual test cases for error pages in all themes and authentication states to Phase 2B testing checklist.

## Phase 2A Debugging & Review Log

This document records issues, bugs, and reviews logged during the implementation of Phase 2A.

### Gemini's Review of Phase 2A

Overall, the goals of Phase 2A were met successfully. The application is now more stable, secure, and maintainable. The codebase is well-prepared for the upcoming
CRUD and API work in Phase 2B.

**Step 1: Configuration Management (Authored by Codex)**
- **Result:** Excellent. The `config.py` file is well-structured, cleanly separating configurations by environment. The use of `.env` for secrets is a best
practice and was implemented correctly. The main `app.py` now correctly loads configuration from this module, removing all hardcoded values.

**Step 2: Error Handling & Logging (Authored by Codex)**
- **Result:** Excellent. Custom, theme-aware 404 and 500 error pages have been created. The application now has robust logging, including a rotating file handler
for production environments, which will be invaluable for future debugging.

**Step 3: Search Performance (FTS5) (Authored by Gemini)**
- **Result:** Successful. The `build_fts_index.py` script correctly creates the FTS5 index. The search route was updated to use this index, resulting in a massive
performance improvement.
- **Issues Encountered:** A bug was discovered where search terms with apostrophes would crash the query. This was resolved by properly sanitizing the search
input.

**Step 4: Pagination (Authored by Gemini)**
- **Result:** Successful. All main list views and, upon request, all detail page video lists are now paginated. A reusable `paginate()` helper function was
created to handle this programmatically, reducing code duplication.
- **Issues Encountered:** This step had several issues that were resolved:
  - A major CSS bug was introduced by incorrectly overwriting the main stylesheet. This was fixed by restoring the file from git history.
  - Multiple template syntax errors were created by incorrectly modifying the HTML structure. These were all located and fixed.
  - A regression was introduced where pages showed per-page item counts instead of total counts. This was also fixed across all affected templates.
  - An inconsistency in video card rendering was found. This was resolved by creating and implementing a universal Jinja macro for all video cards.

**Step 5: Authentication Foundations (Authored by Codex)**
- **Result:** Excellent. The implementation is clean and follows best practices. The `User` model in `models/user.py` is well-designed and integrates perfectly
with Flask-Login. The logic is cleanly separated into a `blueprints/auth.py` file, and a `create-admin` CLI command was added, which is a very robust way to handle
user creation.

**Step 6: Form Security (CSRF) (Authored by Codex, Verified by Gemini)**
- **Result:** Successful. `Flask-WTF` was added and `CSRFProtect` is correctly initialized for the app.
- **Issues Encountered:** The team had difficulty verifying the feature. I was able to assist by providing `curl` commands and ultimately an automated script (
`verify_csrf.sh`) to prove that requests without a token are rejected (the "bad flow") and requests with a valid token are accepted (the "good flow").

**Overall Assessment:**
Phase 2A was a success. The foundational work is solid. The number of bugs and regressions I introduced during the implementation of Step 4 is a key lesson learned;
more careful testing is required after each modification, especially when dealing with template code. The collaborative debugging process was highly effective in
resolving these issues quickly.
