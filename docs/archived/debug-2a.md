# Phase 2A QA Findings

## Initial Review (Codex)

### 1. Missing Template (High Severity) ✅ RESOLVED
- **Issue:** `/auth/profile` view renders `auth/profile.html`, but the template is absent (`blueprints/auth.py:52`).
- **Impact:** Any request to `/auth/profile` raises a 500.
- **Resolution:** Added `templates/auth/profile.html` with theme-aware user profile display.

### 2. Dog Stats Missing Metadata (Medium Severity) ✅ RESOLVED
- **Issue:** Dog stats query only returns `video_count` per dog (directory list), yet the template expects `most_featured.name` (`app.py:368-370`, `templates/dogs_list.html:57`).
- **Impact:** "Most Featured" card shows blank name/count.
- **Resolution:** Expanded query to fetch full dog records with name and video_count (`app.py:369-373`).

### 3. Paged Totals Misreported (Medium Severity) ✅ RESOLVED
- **Issue:** Templates display counts based on current page lengths (`series|length`, `trips|length`, `dogs|…|length`). After pagination, these no longer represent the full dataset.
- **Resolution:** Updated all list templates to use `pagination.total` for accurate counts (dogs_list.html:10, series_list.html:10, trips_list.html:10, people_list.html:10).

### 4. FTS Index Maintenance (Medium Severity) ✅ RESOLVED
- **Issue:** `build_fts_index.py` drops/rebuilds the FTS table and bulk-loads data but no triggers keep `videos_fts` in sync with `videos`.
- **Impact:** Any new or updated videos require rerunning the script before they appear in search results.
- **Resolution:** Added INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE triggers to `build_fts_index.py` (lines 45-61) to automatically maintain FTS index.

### 5. Documentation Cleanup (Low Severity) ✅ RESOLVED
- **Issue:** Step 3 in `docs/phase-2a.md` duplicates the bullet list (checked & unchecked copies).
- **Resolution:** Removed duplicate lines from phase-2a.md.

## Second Review (Claude)

### 6. Logging Configuration Lacks Size Limits (Low-Medium Severity) ✅ RESOLVED
- **Issue:** `RotatingFileHandler` in `configure_logging()` (`app.py:72-79`) doesn't specify `maxBytes` or `backupCount` parameters.
- **Impact:** Log files could grow unbounded in production, potentially filling disk space.
- **Resolution:** Added size limits to RotatingFileHandler at app.py:73 (`maxBytes=10*1024*1024, backupCount=5`).

### 7. CSRF Security Hardening Missing (Low-Medium Severity) ✅ RESOLVED
- **Issue:** Flask-WTF CSRF protection is initialized but lacks security configuration in `config.py`.
- **Impact:** CSRF tokens never expire and lack additional SSL validation in production.
- **Resolution:** Added `WTF_CSRF_TIME_LIMIT=3600` and `WTF_CSRF_SSL_STRICT=True` to `ProductionConfig` (config.py:58-59).

### 8. No Production Secret Key Validation (Medium Severity) ✅ RESOLVED
- **Issue:** Application uses `SECRET_KEY` default `'dev-secret-change-me'` if `FLASK_SECRET_KEY` env var not set (`config.py:26`).
- **Impact:** Production deployment could run with insecure default key, compromising session security.
- **Resolution:** Added validation in `ProductionConfig.init_app()` that raises `RuntimeError` if default key is used (config.py:62-65).

### 9. Error Templates Not Theme-Tested (Low Severity) ⚠️ NOTED FOR PHASE 2B
- **Issue:** Error templates (`templates/errors/404.html`, `500.html`) extend `base.html` but no explicit verification they render properly with all three themes and with/without authenticated users.
- **Impact:** Error pages might display incorrectly in edge cases (e.g., error during login).
- **Status:** Added manual testing requirement to phase-2a.md (line 26). To be validated during Phase 2B QA.

## Summary

**All critical and medium severity issues: RESOLVED ✅**

Phase 2A is complete and production-ready with proper error handling, logging, security hardening, and performance optimizations. One low-severity note remains for manual theme testing during Phase 2B.

### Gemini's Review of Phase 2A

Overall, the goals of Phase 2A were met successfully. The application is now more stable, secure, and maintainable. The codebase is well-prepared for the upcoming
CRUD and API work in Phase 2B.

**Step 1: Configuration Management (Authored by Codex)**
- **Result:** Excellent. The `config.py` file is well-structured, cleanly separating configurations by environment. The use of `.env` for secrets is a best
practice and was implemented correctly. The main `app.py` now correctly loads configuration from this module, removing all hardcoded values.

**Step 2: Error Handling & Logging (Authored by Codex)**
- **Result:** Excellent. Custom, theme-aware 404 and 500 error pages have been created. The application now has robust logging, including a rotating file handler
for production environments, which will be invaluable for future debugging.

**Step 3: Search Performance (FTS5) (Authored by Gemini)**
- **Result:** Successful. The `build_fts_index.py` script correctly creates the FTS5 index. The search route was updated to use this index, resulting in a massive
performance improvement.
- **Issues Encountered:** A bug was discovered where search terms with apostrophes would crash the query. This was resolved by properly sanitizing the search
input.

**Step 4: Pagination (Authored by Gemini)**
- **Result:** Successful. All main list views and, upon request, all detail page video lists are now paginated. A reusable `paginate()` helper function was
created to handle this programmatically, reducing code duplication.
- **Issues Encountered:** This step had several issues that were resolved:
  - A major CSS bug was introduced by incorrectly overwriting the main stylesheet. This was fixed by restoring the file from git history.
  - Multiple template syntax errors were created by incorrectly modifying the HTML structure. These were all located and fixed.
  - A regression was introduced where pages showed per-page item counts instead of total counts. This was also fixed across all affected templates.
  - An inconsistency in video card rendering was found. This was resolved by creating and implementing a universal Jinja macro for all video cards.

**Step 5: Authentication Foundations (Authored by Codex)**
- **Result:** Excellent. The implementation is clean and follows best practices. The `User` model in `models/user.py` is well-designed and integrates perfectly
with Flask-Login. The logic is cleanly separated into a `blueprints/auth.py` file, and a `create-admin` CLI command was added, which is a very robust way to handle
user creation.

**Step 6: Form Security (CSRF) (Authored by Codex, Verified by Gemini)**
- **Result:** Successful. `Flask-WTF` was added and `CSRFProtect` is correctly initialized for the app.
- **Issues Encountered:** The team had difficulty verifying the feature. I was able to assist by providing `curl` commands and ultimately an automated script (
`verify_csrf.sh`) to prove that requests without a token are rejected (the "bad flow") and requests with a valid token are accepted (the "good flow").

**Overall Assessment:**
Phase 2A was a success. The foundational work is solid. The number of bugs and regressions I introduced during the implementation of Step 4 is a key lesson learned;
more careful testing is required after each modification, especially when dealing with template code. The collaborative debugging process was highly effective in
resolving these issues quickly.

## Codex Follow-up Actions
- ✅ Added `templates/auth/profile.html` so `/auth/profile` renders without error.
- ✅ Expanded dog stats query and replaced paginated counts with `pagination.total` in dog/series/trip templates.
- ✅ Reworked `build_fts_index.py` to drop/rebuild triggers and keep FTS in sync; ran the script to apply changes.
- ✅ Cleaned duplicate Step 3 bullets and noted theme-testing requirement in `docs/phase-2a.md`.
- ✅ Strengthened logging (10MB rotation), CSRF config defaults, and production secret-key validation in `config.py`.
